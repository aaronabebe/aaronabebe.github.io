During and after finishing my Bachelors degree in Media Informatics from University of Vienna, I worked at 
<a href="https://compaxdigital.com/" target='_blank'>Compax</a> focusing on Java development and database migrations for large 
scale systems of for german telecommunication companies. The work there was cut short after a few months,
 which led to me taking a break and travelling.

My next work opportunity arose at Raiffeisen Software where I was part of their trainee-program and consequently part of the 
cross cutting concerns and API Team. 
During my time there I took on different responsibilities, from implementing JavaEE services, to contributing to internal frameworks 
and architectural initiatives, to proposing the redesign of the company website and being a part of the commitee to run the yearly 
developer conference RSG DevCon.

After that I have been focusing on my new company: <a href="https://zackplan.com" target='_blank'>zackplan</a>. 
We try to innovate the real estate marketing business by using a cutting edge approach to visualize floorplans. 
Using machine learning and different image recognition techniques, we analyze pictures of floorplans, to generate 3D and VR 
visualizations of flats. There, I brought in my expertise in distributed systems design, data science as well as DevOps. 
During the two years I also became very proficient in working with Blender as well as Blender's Python API. 

After two very succesful years, in which we where able to fulfill a lot of our goals, with the help of great customers 
and some public grants, I decided to look for different opportunities and focus on finishing my Master's deegree.

Currently I am working on my master thesis in cooperation with <a href="https://www.oscar-navigation.com/" target='_blank'>OSCAR Navigation</a>. 
There I will be looking to use Contrastive Learning and other pre-training steps to improve their internal machine learning models.
